<h1>NAS vs SAN </h1>
<p>

People have asked my this question enough number of times. I suppose the answer has always been that  NAS is file level
and SAN is block level , but there is more to this. In this post , I'll try and assemble my understanding so far , so that
I could give a more concrete explanation the next time some one asks me this question. 

One of the major difference is the fact that , SAN is a network designed specifically to connect different storage subsystems. NAS on the other hand is the storage subsystem that is connected over a 
general purpose network.
